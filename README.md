# Matrix Architect

Matrix Architect is the **Architect / Executor service** of the Matrix ecosystem.

It is responsible for **building, fixing, verifying, deploying, and publishing software artifacts** based on structured plans generated by intelligent systems or humans.

Matrix Architect safely turns *intent into action*.

---

## Why Matrix Architect exists

Modern AI systems can reason, plan, and propose solutions — but they often lack a safe, auditable way to **apply those solutions to real systems**.

Matrix Architect closes this gap by providing:

- Controlled code modification
- Deterministic execution
- Verification and rollback
- Policy-aware deployment
- Full auditability

It is the missing execution layer for autonomous and semi-autonomous systems.

---

## Core Responsibilities

Matrix Architect can:

- Generate or receive structured plans
- Apply minimal, reversible code changes
- Run tests, builds, and static checks
- Deploy services via adapters
- Package agents, tools, and MCP servers
- Publish artifacts to Matrix Hub
- Track jobs, artifacts, and outcomes

All execution is **policy-gated** and **observable**.

---

## Position in the Matrix Ecosystem

Matrix Architect works alongside other Matrix services:

- **Matrix AI** – planning, reasoning, code generation
- **Matrix Guardian** – policy enforcement and approvals
- **Matrix Hub** – artifact registry and distribution
- **Matrix System** – orchestration, SDK, CLI, and dashboards

Together, these services form a **closed-loop, safety-first multi-intelligence system**.

## Key Concepts

### Plans

A plan is a structured set of steps describing **what should change**, not how to guess it.

Plans can be:

* generated locally using CrewAI
* requested from Matrix AI
* supplied by a human

---

### File Operations

Matrix Architect applies changes using explicit file operations:

* create
* update
* delete

This allows:

* diff-based patching
* clean rollback
* precise auditing

---

### Verification

Before deployment or publication, Matrix Architect can:

* run tests
* run builds
* run linters or static analyzers

Verification artifacts are stored and exposed.

---

### Policy & Safety

Matrix Architect:

* scores actions by risk
* can block unsafe operations
* can request approval from Matrix Guardian
* produces complete execution logs

Safety is enforced by design.

---

## API Overview

* `POST /plan` – Generate or accept a plan
* `POST /execute` – Apply a plan
* `GET /jobs` – List jobs
* `GET /jobs/{id}` – Job details
* `GET /artifacts/{job_id}/{name}` – Retrieve artifacts

---

## CLI Usage

```bash
matrix-architect plan --repo /path/to/repo --goal "Fix failing tests"
matrix-architect execute --job-id <JOB_ID>
```

---

## Running Locally

```bash
uvicorn matrix_architect.api.app:app --reload --port 8080
```

Or via Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## Design Principles

* Safety-first execution
* Minimal and reversible changes
* Human-in-the-loop support
* Clear separation of concerns
* Production-grade observability

---

## Vision

Matrix Architect is a foundational component for **living software systems** — systems that can:

* detect issues
* reason about solutions
* apply fixes
* verify outcomes
* evolve responsibly

It enables intelligence to act without sacrificing control.
